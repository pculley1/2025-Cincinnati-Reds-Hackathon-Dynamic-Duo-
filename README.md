BatterQuery.py and PitcherQuery.py are the original code files used to query the Baseball Savant database. These queries generated the raw data that our team cleaned and refined using multiple statistical techniques. The resulting datasets were used to create linear regression models using the Data Analysis ToolPak in Excel (files not provided here). Finally, PlayingTimePredictor.py ties everything together, querying the Baseball Savant and Lahman databases for only the necessary information needed to use the regression models generated in Excel and then employing those models to make a prediction for how much playing time a player will receive in 2024.
