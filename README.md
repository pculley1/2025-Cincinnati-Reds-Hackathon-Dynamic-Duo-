BatterQuery.py and PitcherQuery.py are the original code files used to query the Baseball Savant database. These queries generated the raw data that our team cleaned and refined using multiple statistical techniques. The resulting datasets were inserted into the PlateAppearancesPredictor and BattersFacedPredictor AMPL code files. The .mod and .dat files with the same name work together to produce the optimal coefficient set for a specified model type. Finally, PlayingTimePredictor.py ties everything together, querying the Baseball Savant and Lahman databases for only the necessary information needed to run the regression models generated in the AMPL code and then employing those models to make a prediction for how much playing time a player will receive in 2024.
